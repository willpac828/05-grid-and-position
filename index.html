                <p>I didn't know anything about layouts or placement, really, before the beginning of last week. I had done tutorials and was familiar with a handful of CSS properties, but designing layouts is a whole 'nutha animal.</p>
                <p>I'm more comfortable today with the difference between styling types such as inline-block and floats than I was a couple of days ago. I still find that I am having to guess and check on almost every instance of styling, but I'm confident that it will get better.  </p>

                <p>I keep having to remind myself that, even though I feel behind, I've learned an immense amount in just eight days, and that counts for something. Still, I'm not grasping everything as much as I would like to.</p>
                <p>I still feel like I'm constantly "BSing" concepts in place of the correct and simple solutions. I hope this is something that I will become accustomed to, because it's obvious that best practices and simplicity are valued.</p>

                <p>I'm very impressed with the resiliency of those around me. It's hard for me to commit so many hours in a week to one thing, and I'm amazed that those around me seem so unfazed by it all. Many times I feel like there aren't enough hours in a day.</p>
                <p>I just have to tell myself that I will try to do "everything that I can", every day. If I do that, then eventually I will be caught up, and will feel like this course is manageable. I don't want to be behind going into the javascript portion of this class.</p>

                <p>I'm not a person who has a whole lot of confidence. I inwardly characterize myself as a quitter, and I'm afraid to do hard things or to push myself out of my comfort zone. I want to be the type who perseveres, and I'm hoping that this program will give me the confidence to try new things in the future.</p>
                <p>I hope that we continue to do layouts during the javascript portion of the class so that I can continue to affirm those concepts.</p>
